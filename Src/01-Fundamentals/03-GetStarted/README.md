Key background:

C# is used to build many kinds of software, including:
- Mobile applications
- Desktop applications
- Web applications
- Web services
- Web sites
- Games
- VR (Virtual Reality)
- Database applications
- And much, much more!

### Why use C#?

- It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
- It is easy to learn and simple to use
- It has huge community support
- C# is an object-oriented language, which provides a clear structure and encourages code reuse, lowering development costs
- Because C# is close to C, C++, and Java, it is easier for developers to switch to C# (or switch back)

## C# Get Started

### C# IDE

The easiest way to get started with C# is to use an IDE.

An IDE (**Integrated Development Environment**) is used to edit and compile code.

In this tutorial, we will use **Visual Studio Community**, which is free to download from:
- [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

Applications written in C# use the **.NET Framework**, so it makes sense to use Visual Studio since the program, the framework, and the language are all created by Microsoft.

### C# Install

Once the **Visual Studio Installer** is downloaded and installed:
1. Choose the **.NET workload**
2. Click the **Modify/Install** button
